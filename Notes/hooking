At least the following functions  in kernel32.dll will have to be hooked to emulate vim:

FillConsoleOutputAttribute
FillConsoleOutputCharacterW
GetConsoleCP
GetConsoleCursorInfo
GetConsoleMode
GetConsoleOutputCP
GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo
GetConsoleTitleW
GetStdHandle
ReadConsoleInputW
ReadConsoleOutputW
ReadConsoleOutputAttribute
ReadFile
SetConsoleCtrlHandler
SetConsoleCursorInfo
SetConsoleCursorPosition
SetConsoleMode
SetConsoleScreenBufferSize
SetConsoleTextAttribute
SetConsoleTitleW
SetStdHandle
WriteFile
WriteConsoleW
WriteConsoleOutputW
WriteConsoleOutputAttribute
WriteConsoleOutputCharacterW
WriteConsoleW

Actually all their A variants, too, because unluckily the A ones no longer call the W ones internally it seems.

Furthermore:

CreateProcess(Ex)
LoadLibrary(Ex)

Apparently 32-bit processes cannot call CreateRemoteThread in 64-bit processes, but 64-bit processes can call it in both 32-bit and 64-bit processes.
Furthermore, I also discovered that the 64-bit system DLLs in Windows 7 unluckily have no regular mov edi, edi style hot patching intros so it would be easier to patch the IAT entries in the EXE and all the DLLs it uses/loads.
