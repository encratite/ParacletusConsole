To do:

Support vim, ssh etc - i.e. implement full Windows console buffer emulation
Add a browsable command history
Make keybinds like escape, tab and the suspend key configurable
Add a button which suspends the active process
Add some arguments to ps and ls and such
Add */** syntax
It would be nice if you were able to paste multiple lines into the input box
A space in front of the command prevents it from getting highlighted
Sometimes the main controls are not resized when the form is maximised, it is unclear to me why this happens
When one is tabbing, the auto completion does not replace the rest of the path in the previous directories, this can lead to some nasty strings and even broken concatenations

Not possible:

This code does not work well with Mono on Linux anymore, it would be nice to figure out why but it looks like this is a severe bug in its Winforms code - even though Windows is the primary target

Done:

The auto completion list should be auto height and width adjusted up to a certain maximum
The XML configuration file path must be initialised on launch, so it is an absolute path and doesn't get influenced by the current working directory
Double clicks on the auto completion list should perform replacements
There is still some exception oddity: A first chance exception of type 'System.InvalidOperationException' occurred in System.Windows.Forms.dll
	(This was a result of some missing checks on position updates etc)
