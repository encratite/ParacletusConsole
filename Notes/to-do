To do:

When one is tabbing, the auto completion does not replace the rest of the path in the previous directories, this can lead to some nasty strings and even broken concatenations

Done:

The auto completion list should be auto height and width adjusted up to a certain maximum
Double clicks on the auto completion list should perform replacements
There is still some exception oddity: A first chance exception of type 'System.InvalidOperationException' occurred in System.Windows.Forms.dll
	(This was a result of some missing checks on position updates etc)
